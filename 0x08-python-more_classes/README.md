<h1>Python - More classes</h1>
<h2>Examples</h2>
0- create an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle</br>
1- based on (0-), add constructor, private instances like width, height</br>
2- based on (1-), add methods area and perimeter to calculate respectively
the area and the perimeter of any rectangle</br>
3- based on (2-), add the methods <code>print()</code> and <code>str()</code> 
to print the rectangle</br>
4- based on (3-), get the string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using <code>eval()</code></br>
5- based on (4-), print a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted</br>
6- based on (5-), add class attribute <code>number_of_instances</code>, that increments for each instance of the class created and decrements for each instance deletion</br>
7- based on (6-), add class attribute <code>print_symbol</code>, used as symbol for string representation</br>
8- based on (7-), add static method that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area</br>
9- based on (8-), add a class method that returns a new Rectangle instance with <code>width == height == size</code></br>
10- The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
