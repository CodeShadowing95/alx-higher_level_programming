<h1>Python - Error and Exceptions</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program and and not unconditionally fatal. Most exceptions are not handled by Python.</br>
An error is generally detected when the syntax of the code is not properly written.</br>
To catch an exception, we use the <code>try...except</code> statements to deal with specific exceptions. As example of exceptions, we have ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, RuntimeError,...and so on.</br>
<h2>Examples</h2>
0- Safe list printing</br>
1- safe printing of an integers list</br>
2- print the first n elements of a list and only integers</br>
3- divide 2 integers and print the result</br>
4- divide element by element, 2 lists</br>
5- raise a type exception</br>
6- raise a name exception with a message</br>
7- safe integer printing with error message</br>
